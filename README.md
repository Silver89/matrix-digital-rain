# Enter the Matrix
A 'just for fun' PHP console version of the classic [Matrix digital rain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_digital_rain)

## Motivation
The Matrix code is very well known from the classic films so I thought I'd bring it to life in command line php.

## Installation
It's simple to run, just open up a terminal and run the index.php file - it's set to autorun so that's all you really need to do to enter the Matrix!

```
<?php

require 'matrix.php';

$matrix = new Matrix();
$matrix->enter();
```

### Morpheus
Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real? What if you were unable to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?
